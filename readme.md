# Welcome to the most ridiculously over-engineered Draft Order Generator

Hey there, RFDGNFLers! We're gonna use use this absurdly complex piece of software to select our draft order this year (every year?) because why not.

## How I'm Running it

1. Run `ruby rfdgnfl_draft_order.rb` and watch the magic happen.
2. The script will randomly generate an order for your draft, announce the lucky first picker with a fanfare, and the unlucky last picker with a sad trombone. Because we're all about the drama here.

## Requirements

You'll need Ruby installed, and the 'mpg123' command line audio player. If you don't have 'mpg123', you can install it using brew with `brew install mpg123`. If you don't have brew... well, Google is your friend.

## Disclaimer

This script was created by a programmer with too much time on their hands (Doug). It's open sourced so all you whiners can see that there's no funny stuff.

Now go forth, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
